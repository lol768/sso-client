Feature: Webgroup service
  In order to give users access to Webgroups information
  As an application developer
  I need to be able to query the Webgroups server
  
  Scenario: Get group by name
    Given that the group "in-testgroup" exists with these members:
      | User ID |
      | cus001  |
      | cus002  |
      | cus009  |
    When I call groupService.getGroupByname("in-testgroup")
    Then I should receive a Group object containing those members
    
  Scenario: Get group that doesn't exist
    Given that the group "in-testgroup" doesn't exist
    When I call groupService.getGroupByname("in-testgroup")
    Then a GroupNotFoundException should be thrown
